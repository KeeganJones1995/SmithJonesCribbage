WORK IN PROGRESS
***Disclaimer***
This is NOT a finished product.  This is up to display what I have done so far. As of September 23rd 2019, I am close to finishing but still have a few bugs to fix and a few minor features to implement.  The game play is working as I want it to but I am hung up on this bug causing the browser to become unresponsive when the game transitions rounds.
Other things still to be done are:
-fix bug causing browser to become non-responsive upon starting of a new round of play	
-reduce/eliminate global variables
-work on connectivity issues(e.g. user discconnects mid game etc.)
-addition of third player feature(optional)
-movement of pegs down the sinusodal curve(the board)
-create more detailed comments
-better encapsulate some functionality and make code more reusable
-general cleaning up of the code
